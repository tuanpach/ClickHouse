-- Reproducer for out-of-bounds access in partial_disjunction_result bitset.
-- When use_primary_key = 0, the key_condition RPN has 1 element (skip_analysis_),
-- so the check key_condition.getRPN().size() <= 32 passes trivially.
-- But the key_condition_rpn_template and index conditions have the full RPN,
-- which can exceed 32 elements, leading to out-of-bounds writes in the callback.
-- The disjunction feature requires at least 2 useful skip indexes and OR conditions.
